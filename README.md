# mirror_of_fo_rorrim - a palindrome puzzle game

Players will see a series of phrases, each of which is _almost_ a palindrome. The catch is that in each phrase, one word needs to be replaced. Players advance to the next puzzle by saying the correct word into a microphone.

**Example phrase**: burrito cat

**Solution**: taco (replace burrito with taco to form a full palindrome)
